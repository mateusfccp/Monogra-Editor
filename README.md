Front-end Single-page-application editor used in Monogra

## Installing

Clone to your PC. Then, install node dependencies:

```
$ npm install
```

Then, install Elm dependencies:

```
$ elm package install
```

Then, run the gulp build task:

```
$ gulp build
```

After this, I hope the CSS and JS has been successfully compiled.
Now, you can access the `index.html` file of the root folder and it should be working.
